              In the main stage of coaching, tutors work one-on-one with students to build an outstanding, complete student profile and exceptional application to send to colleges. Our tutors were admitted to many of the most selective schools in the nation, and can share their first-hand experience with the application process. In our in-depth, comprehensive approach, we coach students in each of the following subjects: <br /><br />
              <ul>
                <li>How to choose the right courses and extracurricular activities while in high school.</li>
                <li>How to productively and effectively spend summers in high school.</li>
                <li>The importance of test scores and how to succeed on standardized tests.</li>
                <li>How to maximize the impact of recommendation letters and whom to choose as your recommenders.</li>
                <li>How to make interviews count. We’ll guide you through every step of the process and hold mock interviews so that you can walk in with confidence, make the most of the conversation, and walk out knowing you made a meaningful impression.</li>
                <li>Every aspect of the CommonApp and unique applications. Here we help students compose essays of the highest quality and answer writing supplements in an outstanding and unique way. Our goal is to bring out a student’s best writing while presenting a complete and inimitable picture of the student that will have a powerful impact on admissions officers.</li>
